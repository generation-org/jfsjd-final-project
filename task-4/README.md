# Task 4: Adding Items (posts or products)

## Description

For this task, we'll be
1. Creating a class to manage the items (products or posts)
2. Adding a method to the class to keep track of items in our application

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: The Setup

In this step, we'll re-organise our folder structure in preparation for the next few steps.

1. Create a `js` folder in your project if one does not already exist
2. Copy the existing js file into your `js` folder, and rename it to `index.js`
3. Update the `<script>` tag in your `html` file to use the new location of the `js/index.js` file.
4. Create a `itemsController.js` file in the `js` folder
5. Add a `<script>` tag pointing to the `js/itemsController.js` file _before_ the `<script>` tag pointing to the `js/index.js` file.

### Step 2: The ItemsController Class

In this step, we'll create a `ItemsController` class that 
will be responsible for managing the items(posts or products) in the application.

Always aim to use meaningful and long names to make your code more readable. We encourage you to replace the word `Items` with a more meaningful one depending on your project domain:
* PostsController
* ProductsController

1. Create a `ItemsController` class in `js/itemsController.js`
2. Within the `constructor` of the `ItemsController` class, initialize a `this.items` property on the class, Make the property equal to an empty array.

> Now is a good chance to test your code, head over to `js/itemsController.js` and do the following
>
> 1. Initialize a new instance of `ItemsController`
> 2. `console.log()` the `items` property
>
> **Expected Result**
> You should see an empty array logged to the browser.

### Step 3: Adding A New Item Programmatically

In this step, we'll add a method to the `ItemsController` class that will allow us to add new items to array.

As part of this process, we're going to create a unique `id` for each item.

For each item to have a unique `id`, we will need to keep track of what `id` the latest task was created with, so that we can increment that `id` for the next item.

For example, pay attention to the two `items` objects below:
```js

//E-commerce project
const product1 = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Tayto',
    description: 'Cheese & Onion Chips',
    img: 'https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4078148!/image/image.jpg'
    createdAt: '2020-09-20'
};

const product2 = {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Water',
    description: 'Mineral water',
    img: 'http://www.mazalv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Bottled-Water1-979x1024-1-979x1024.png'
    createdAt: '2020-09-20'
};


//Social Media project
const post1 = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'My first post',
    text: 'This is my first post',
    img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Post-greenland-uummannaq.jpg/1200px-Post-greenland-uummannaq.jpg"
    author: 'Andres Lowles',
    createdAt: '2020-09-20'
};

const post2 = {
    id: 2,
    name: 'My second post',
    text: 'This is my second post',
    img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Post-greenland-uummannaq.jpg/1200px-Post-greenland-uummannaq.jpg"
    author: 'Andres Lowles',
    createdAt: '2020-09-20'
};
```

Notice how each item has a unique `id`? We will be using this `id` in future steps to keep track of the different items. 

> #### Useful Resources for this step
> - [Array.prototype.push()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)

1. In the `ItemsController`'s `constructor`, accept a `currentId` parameter, with a default value of `0`.
2. Assign the `currentId` to a new property on the class, `this.currentId`.
3. Create a method on the class, `addItem`. This method should accept all the nessecary information from the form to create an item as parameters.
    * Product
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - `img`
    - `createdAt`
    * Post
    - `name`
    - `text`
    - `img`
    - `author`
    - `createdAt`
 
4. Within the `addItem` method, increment the `this.currentId`
5. `push` a new item into the `this.items` array, with the correct properties of the item, using the values passed in as parameters as well as the new `this.currentId`
    **Note** Make sure to include the `id`

> #### Test Your Code!
> Now is a good chance to test your code, head over to `js/itemsController.js` and do the following
>
> 1. Initialize a new instance of `ItemsController`
> 2. Use the `addItem` method to add a new item
> 2. `console.log()` the `items` property
>
> **Expected Result**
> You should see an array containing the added item logged to the browser.

## Results

We've now set up the `ItemsController` class, create an `addItem` and you are able to see the output on the browser console!

Test out your code by hardcoding items and checking the `ItemsController` instance's `items` array for the tasks.
